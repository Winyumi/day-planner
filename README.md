# Day Planner

## Introduction

Need to jot down your tasks for the day? Use this simple tool to list out what you need to do! Each time block is highlighted based on the current time of the day, where the current hour is lit up and the past and future hours are more faded.

All tasks will be saved on your browser locally. They will persist even after the browser is closed and reopened, until your browser cache has been emptied.
